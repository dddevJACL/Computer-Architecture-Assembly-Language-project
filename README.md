This program uses macros and procedures in conjuntion to prompt a user for 10 signed integers that fit within a 32 bit register.
It then shows the user a list of the integers they inputted, the sum of all integers, and their truncated average.
This program also prints each line number, as well as the running subtotal, and the running average with each user input.
